# What Is Copilot?

Copilot is a set of extensions for VS Code:

 - There's Copilot itself, and
 - The Chat extension, which let's you work with Copilot through a dedicated window, the terminal, or in the editor.

To install Copilot, open your extensions and type `copilot`. Install it, authenticate with GitHub, and you're off.

Now you can:

 - Use the chat window by clicking on the messaging icon on your sidebar.
 - Use inline chat by using CTRL-I or CMD-I on a Mac.
 - Use chat in the terminal by using CTRL-I or CMD-I on a Mac.
 - See Ghost text, which is a just-in-time helper that appears magically.
