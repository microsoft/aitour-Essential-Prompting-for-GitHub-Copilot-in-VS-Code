# GETTING THE PROJECT GITHUB READY

Almost done, you have a project with source code including a database. What's missing are common project files.

For this, use either Edits or Agent mode.

EDITS:

> Prompt: generate the markdown files that a reputable open source project would have on GitHub. Make me look like a pro

EXPERIMENTAL AGENT MODE!!

> Prompt: create the project and install the packages for the project using npm. create the needed markdown files for a professional open source project (detailed README, Code of Conduct, Contributing guidelines, Security, MIT License) and anything else you deem necessary. Use lots of emoji for the new markdown files and make it look fun.
