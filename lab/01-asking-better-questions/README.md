# Interactive Chats with Copilot

You can use Copilot to make your day a lot more efficient, such as answering coding questions right in VS Code, or generating commit messages for you. It can also do complex tasks, like creating and editing code files, as well as executing terminal commands.

Try it! Open up Copilot on the right side of the editor, and then the chat window. Let's ask some questions...

## How to do a for loop?

 - Ask the question: `how do I do a for loop?`
 - The answer will be generic, spanning 3-4 different programming languages.
 - It's interesting to compare and contrast, isn't it?

## How to do a for loop in JavaScript?

 - Ask the question again, but be specific about your language of choice (such as `how do I do a for loop in JavaScript`).
 - Notice that the response is now much more focused.

## I heard about Tail Recursion once...

Tail recursion is a functional programming way of doing a loop, where a function calls itself until a condition is reached. It's an advanced topic, but Copilot can help us learn it:

 - Oh, wait, what I really want to know is `how do I do a for loop in JavaScript using tail recursion`.

Many languages don't support tail recursion, but JavaScript does!

## Changing Models

By default, Copilot uses the OpenAI GPT 4o model, but you can use others.

 - Open the dropdown below the chat that says "ChatGPT4o"
 - Change to "Claude Sonnet 3.5" as it does very well with code questions. 

Try the other models too - each one is very unique.
