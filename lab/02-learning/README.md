# Learning With Copilot

You can use Copilot to teach you new concepts, even entire languages and frameworks. Let's learn Rust.


  - Open the chat window and ask: `@vscode what are the best extensions for working with Rust?`. You will see a list of useful extensions.
  - Ask Copilot `what is the file extension for a Rust code file?`. You should see `.rs` as the result.
  - Create a file called `app.rs`, which is a Rust code file.
  - Use CTRL-I in `app.rs` to ask for the starting code: `create a class or module that has the following string methods: reverse, camelCase, capitalize, isPalindromeÂ `. Examine the code, compare to your current language.

## Bonus 

There's even more to do! Try entering this as a prompt in the chat window:

`I want to learn Rust and I learn best by doing. Create a tutorial for me that covers the basics. Go step by step, but don't move to the next step until I say 'next'. Each step should show me a basic concept in Rust`.

You're on your way to learning Rust!
