# Creating a Changelog

There's no Git repo here, but feel free to use one of your own. The demo can still work.

## Part 1: Get the commits

 - Open a terminal and, using inline chat: `how can I save all commit messages to a file?`. You should see the `git log` command come up, with some extra arguments.
 - Don't run this; simply mention that you already did that, which is where the commits.txt file comes in.

## Part 2: The Changelog

  - Create a new file called CHANGELOG
  - Open the chat window: `using #file:commits.txt create a CHANGELOG`.
  - Add the output to CHANGELOG.
  - Using inline chat: `remove dependabot and Bump messages`
  - Next: `make all commits grammatically correct, remove offensive words, and be as detailed as possible.`
  - **If you get a weird error inline (which happens), use chat window**
  - Add `add emoji where possible`
  - Accept the changes and we're done.
