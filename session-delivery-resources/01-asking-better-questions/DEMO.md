# Interactive Chats with Copilot

Shorten the web search "question/answer" loop with Copilot Chat. Ask questions, get rapid answers with context!

## How to do a for loop?

 - Ask the question: `how do I do a for loop?`
 - The answer will be generic, spanning 3-4 different programming languages

## How to do a for loop in JavaScript?

 - Ask the question again, but be specific about your language of choice (such as `how do I do a for loop in JavaScript`).

## The prompt keeps growing...

We keep getting answers, which push us to ask more questions.

 - Oh, wait, what I really want to know is `how do I do a for loop in JavaScript using tail recursion`.

This is the nature of learning how to prompt. Notice that the answers become more and more relevant to our needs.

## Changing Models

 - By default, Copilot uses the OpenAI GPT 4o model, but you can use others.
 - Claude Sonnet does very well with code questions. Change the model, and as the `for loop` question again by hitting the UP arrow to repeat the prompt.
