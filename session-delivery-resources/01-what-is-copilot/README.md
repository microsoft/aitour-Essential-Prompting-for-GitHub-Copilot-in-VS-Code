# What Is Copilot?

Starting from nothing, we want to show what Copilot is, and how it works in general.

  - Open up extensions, show the Copilot extension along with chat.
  - Create an empty document, something like `index.js`, show inline chat at the top using CTRL-I.
  - Open a terminal session using CTRL-backtick and show inline in the terminal.
  - Go back to the code document you just created (`index.js`) and create a comment for a function that reverses a string. This should fire up Ghost text.
  - Add another that "sluggify's" a string.
