# Learning With Copilot

We know what Copilot does, let’s extend things a little more. Using Rust (or another language you might not know), let’s ask VS Code for some help getting started. In this demo, we’ll learn about chat participants:

  - Open the chat window and ask: `@vscode what are the best extensions for working with Rust?`. You will see a list. Install if you want, not required. Replace Rust with a language you don’t know, if you need.
  - Create a file called `app.rs`, which is a Rust code file.
  - Use CTRL-I to ask for the same thing: `create a class or module that has the following string methods: reverse, camelCase, capitalize, isPalindrome `. Examine the code, compare to the output for JS.

## Bonus Content
If you move fast and want to extend the demo, you can ask Copilot to teach you rust in a step-wise way:

`I want to learn Rust and I learn best by doing. Create a tutorial for me that covers the basics. Go step by step, but don't move to the next step until I say 'next'. Each step should show me a basic concept in Rust`.
